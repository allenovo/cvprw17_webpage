We adopt an autoencoder-styled architecture to learn features in an unsupervised manner. The encoder maps input clips to feature tensors by applying a series of 3D convolutions and max-pooling operations. Unlike traditional autoencoder architectures, the bottleneck features are partitioned into three splits which are then used as input for three different reconstruction tasks. The foreground or background features are disentangled by reconstructing corresponding appearances in one frame. And the motion features are modelled as the updating of one foreground appearance to another.

Segmentation masks used for generating ground truth here are obtained from manual labeling. However, it is worth noting that they can be obtained without supervision as well, which remains as our future work.
